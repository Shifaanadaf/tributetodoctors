  <img src="doctor1.JPG" width="30%" height="30%" style="float: left; margin-right: 2%;margin-bottom: 2%;padding: 1%;">
   <p>Medicine is a super competitive and rigorous field: doctors have a lot of responsibility and must spend tons of time and money on their training. Healthcare is also a growing field, which means that the demand for doctors will continue to increase in the coming years.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <br><h2>How to Become a Doctor: 7-Step Career Path Overview</h2><br>
    <p>Becoming a doctor is a pretty complex, multi-step process. Here are the seven major steps we'll be covering in more detail below </p>
    <p>Step 1: Do well in high school<br>
        Step 2: Get into a great college<br>
        Step 3: Take the MCAT (and get a good score)<br>
        Step 4: Apply and get into medical school<br>
        Step 5: Attend medical school and pass your boards to become a licensed doctor<br>
        Step 6: Choose your specialty and complete your residency<br>
        Step 7: Take and pass your final boards to practice independently<br><br></p>
        <h2><B>Step 1: Do Well in High School</B></h2><br><br>
        <p>If you're serious about becoming a doctor, you'll do yourself a big favor by getting focused in high school. As mentioned, this is a pretty competitive field, so the earlier you start distinguishing yourself as a great student, the easier the process will be.</p><br><br>
        <h2><B>Step 2: Get Into a Great College</B></h2><br><br>
        <p>College is where you really start focusing your studies and preparing for a career in medicine.Most medical schools require students to have taken a series of courses as undergraduates. This ensures that they have strong foundational knowledge in math and science and will be well prepared for the more advanced courses they'll have to take as med students.Your transcript will be a very important part of your med school applications, so your academic performance should really be your #1 priority as you work your way through college.</p><br><br>
        <h2><B>Step 3: Take (and Ace!) the MCAT</B></h2><br><br>
        <p>The Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT, is used as a predictor of your success in med school, and as such is weighted pretty heavily when compared to other parts of your application.

            Most students take the MCAT their junior year—this is arguably the most optimal time to take the test. Why? Because by this point you will have gone through many of your pre-med courses, making studying for the MCAT a lot easier.</p><br><br>
            <h2><B>Step 4: Apply and Get Into Medical School
            </B></h2><br><br>
            <p>The medical school application process is extremely long. If you want to start med school the fall after you graduate from college, you'll have to start your applications your junior year.</p><br><br>
            <h2><B>Step 5: Attend Medical School and Pass Your Boards</B></h2><br><br>
            <p>After fulfilling all the pre-med requirements and submitting all those applications, you finally arrive here: medical school. You'll spend four years here, but that doesn't mean the experience will be very similar to that of your undergraduate education—there are more decisions to be made, more opportunities for hands-on experiences, and more professional licensing requirements to worry about.</p><br>
            <p>Here's an overview of what these four years of med school will look like:</p><br>
            <p>Years 1-2: Primarily classroom-based courses</p><br>
            <p>Year 3: Training in each major medical specialty (also known as rotations)</p><br>
            <p>Year 4: Primarily elective courses based on preferred specialty</p><br><br>
            <h2><B>Step 6: Complete Your Residency</B></h2><br><br>
            <p>Residencies, also known as internships, are supervised positions at teaching hospitals. You will be matched to an available residency position through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP).</p><br>
            <p>You'll be able to note your preferences, but you won't have ultimate decision-making power over your matches. Once the NRMP sets you up, you sort of have to take what you're given.</p><br>
            <p>You will spend at least three years in your residency program but may spend more time there depending on your specialty. In your first year, you'll be known as an intern and will be at the bottom of the totem pole—but not for long.</p><br>
            <p>During your residency, you'll also need to pass your final licensing exam (USMLE-3). The third and final licensing exam is taken during the first year of your residency. It tests your ability to utilize your medical knowledge and provide care in an unsupervised setting, which is what you will have to do as a licensed physician.</p><br>
            <h2><B>Step 7: Take and Pass Your Final Boards</B></h2><br><br>
            <p>Once you've finished your residency and passed all your boards, you can officially practice independently as a licensed physician! It probably won't take you long to find work. You might want to practice in a hospital, clinic, or private practice.

                You'll have to keep up with Continuing Medical Education in order to practice as a physician, no matter your specialty; this ensures that you stay educated and up-to-date on the latest research and best medical practices.</p><br><br>
