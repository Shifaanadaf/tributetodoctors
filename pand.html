            Doctors experience high levels of work stress even under normal circumstances, but many would be reluctant to disclose mental health difficulties or seek help for them, with stigma an often-cited reason. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis places additional pressure on doctors and on the healthcare system in general and research shows that such pressure brings a greater risk of psychological distress for doctors. For this reason, we argue that the authorities and healthcare executives must show strong leadership and support for doctors and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak and call for efforts to reduce mental health stigma in clinical workplaces. This can be facilitated by deliberately adding ‘healthcare staff mental health support process’ as an ongoing agenda item to high-level management planning meetings.

        Lack of PPE, poor infection control put medical staff at risk of Covid-19

        Healthcare workers risk contracting Covid-19 due to a lack of infection control in hospitals, doctors say amid complaints about substandard personal protective equipment ( PPE) and lack of basic items like N 95 masks and even sanitisers.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Dr Indranil Khan, an oncologist in Kolkata, who was detained for complaining about sub-standard PPEs on March 29, said doctors are at risk of getting infected along with other patients.“I have friends, juniors, seniors who are working in various hospitals in Kolkata and outside like in Siliguri who will not lie. The material supplied to hospitals has been substandard and inadequate. ...fighting a disease like Covid-19 is not a joke,” said Khan. “...we were not prepared for an epidemic of this scale but government hospitals are not equipped at all which, in turn, will lead to the spread of infection not just among health workers but also among other patients.” He said doctors and sanitation workers interacting with any suspected patient need to be protected because they go to other wards as well.

        Not seeing their family members for days on end, losing patients and working overtime to save lives -- the COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought physical pain but also caused mental agony for doctors. On National Doctors Day, these frontline warriors recount their experiences, which for some was the "worst in their life", while for others, it was so mentally upsetting that they had to consult psychiatrists.

        Neha Rastogi Panda, Consultant, Infectious Disease, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon says she could not visit her father, who is hypertensive and stays in Delhi's Rohini, for two months. Her mother passed away two years ago and she hasn't seen her mother-in-law, who lives in Odisha, for over a year.

        "During the peak of the second wave, my husband and I, who is a lab person, hardly got any time for family, our loved ones. It would always be only a 10-second call to tell them that I am fine and ask if they were doing okay."

      The number of those losing their lives in the line of duty during the COVID-19 pandemic in India continues to remain a matter of concern.
   </p>
   <p>
      According to data available by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) as many as 776 doctors have succumbed to COVID-19 during the second wave so far.

   </p>
   <p>
      Bihar saw the maximum number of 115 deaths, followed by Delhi at 109, Uttar Pradesh 79, West Bengal 62, Rajasthan 43, Jharkhand 39, and Andhra Pradesh 38, the data showed.
   </p>
   <p>
      But in less than a month, nearly 60 more lost their lives, taking the toll past the number of doctors killed in 2020 when the pandemic began.

        Even when doctors and other healthcare workers are putting their lives at risk every day to treat those infected with the virus, they are increasingly coming under physical attacks by relatives of patients.
     </p>
     <p>
        In recent times there has an increase in the number of attacks on doctors across India.
     </p>
     <p>
        Recently, the IMA and other organizations had held protests demanding security for them.
     </p>
     <p>
        The Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishment (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2019, which sought to impose a jail term up to 10 years for assaulting on-duty doctors and other healthcare professionals, was dismissed by the Home Ministry saying the special law was not feasible as health is a state subject, the IMA had said.
     </p>
     <p>
        "There are many central health laws such as the PCPNDT Act and the Clinical Establishment Act. Currently, 21 states have local laws, but what we need is a strong central law to protect doctors from violence," the doctors' body had said.
